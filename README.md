# An-Analysis-of-the-Dublin-rental-market
Data analytics final year project NCI 2019

# Summary
This project was compiled for the BSc (Honours) in Computing program, at the National College of Ireland. The purpose of the project is to analyse the Dublin rental market through the use of the listings on Daft.ie. The project will identifies different areas of the rental market based on location in the city and analyse multiple statistics surrounding the rental market to help potential tenants make decisions on entering the rental market. This information from Daft.ie is then compared to other related data to extract further understanding of the Dublin rental market and to gain an understanding of why the cost of rent has risen dramatically in recent years.
